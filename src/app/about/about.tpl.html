            Vision
        </h2>
        <p>
            At HRRC, we envision a world where human rights are the cornerstone of a student’s education.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, the HRRC is about empowering instructors from all fields and disciplines to incorporate human
            rights into their academic programs.
        </p>

            Mission
        </h2>
        <p>
            HRRC accomplishes its goals by drafting and disseminating human rights lesson plans and supplementary
            materials that both graduate and undergraduate university instructors can weave into lectures on a wide
            range of subjects, including social studies, world history, politics, international relations,
            sociology, courses on business management, and even mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
            HRRC also publishes materials dedicated to the most recent trends in human rights and gives students and instructors alike a platform for discourse and study by submitting and utilizing human rights related articles and papers.
