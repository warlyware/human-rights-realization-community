You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. At home you have unlimited time. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Happy painting, God bless. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Just make little strokes like that. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. Now then, let's play."
